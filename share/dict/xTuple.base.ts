        <source>Sometimes after restoring a database users get unexpected errors relating to permission to modify the data in database tables. This can happen even though the user has been granted privileges through the application.

Click the &quot;Fix&quot; button to try to correct database-level permissions problems. This will only work if you are logged in as a PostgreSQL administrative user.</source>

        <source>A new ICDIST file has been generated in the RealWorld directory.
You should now use the RealWorld icfu/icutil tool to import this file.
After you have successfully imported the ICDIST file click the &apos;Post&apos; button

If, for any reason, you were unable to post the ICDIST file click on the
&apos;Do Not Post&apos; button and re-export G/L Transactions to re-create the IDDIST file.
