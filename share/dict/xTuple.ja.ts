        <source>New ARDIST and AROPEN files have been generated in

successfully imported the ARDIST and AROPEN files click
the &apos;Post&apos; button to mark these items as distributed.
If, for any reason, you were unable to post the ARDIST

        <source>New APDIST and APOPEN files have been generated in the RealWorld directory.
You should now use the RealWorld apfu/aputil tool to import these files.
After you have successfully imported the APDIST and APOPEN files click the &apos;Post&apos; button

If, for any reason, you were unable to post the APDIST and APOPEN files click
on the &apos;Do Not Post&apos; button and Re-Post Vouchers to re-create the APDIST and APOPEN files.
