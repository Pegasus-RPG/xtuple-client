/*! \ingroup scriptapi

  \brief Include the named script(s) in the current script.

  This lets the script developer put commonly used QtScript (JavaScript)
  code in a single place and use it in multiple other %scripts.
  All named %scripts are included in the order listed.
  If more than one script exists with the given name, all of them are included
  in increasing order by script_order. The inclusion is done as the script
  is executed, so if an include() call appears in the middle of a function,
  the include will not be done until that function gets called.
  If any of the included %scripts throws an exception while being included,
  no subsequent %scripts in the list will be processed.

  For example:
  \code
    include("soap2js");
  \endcode
  This tells the current QScriptEngine to use the contents of the script
  named "soap2js" and appears near the top of the weatherForAddress.js script.

  \code
    include("storedProcErrLookup", "xtmfgErrors");
  \endcode
  This tells the current QScriptEngine to use the contents of two %scripts,
  one named "storedProcErrLookup" and the other named "xtmfgErrors".

  \param first  The name of a script to include
  \param second Optional: The name of a second script to include

  \return The number of arguments that were processed

  \see weatherForAddress.js
  \see include.cpp
